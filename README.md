# CS 296-25 Fall 2017 Honors Project

This repository contains the code for my CS 296 final project.  It was
built in collaboration with Jonathan Hoelzel.

## Usage

The main file edit is `src/adventure/core.clj`.

If using Leiningen, use `lein run` from the command line to run the program.
Otherwise, the command (load-file "src/adventure/core.clj") may be useful.
